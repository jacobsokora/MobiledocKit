# MobiledocKit

This is a small library to support the use of the Mobiledoc format in iOS/Cocoa apps.

Mobiledoc is a format largely used in publishing projects and officially supported in Javascript-based environments.

You can read about the format [on the mobiledoc website](https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit/blob/master/MOBILEDOC.md)


Some details of the format are not currently supported, such as `atoms`. PR's or at least failing tests are welcome to improve the project.
